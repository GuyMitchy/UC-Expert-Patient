# Understanding Your Ulcerative Colitis Medications: A Patient's Guide

## [EMERGENCY] Critical Medication Information
- Never stop any medication without talking to your doctor
- If you forget if you've taken your medication, do not take it - contact doctor/pharmacist
- Store medications properly (check if they need refrigeration)
- Watch for severe side effects or signs of infection (fever, severe tiredness)
- Report new or unusual symptoms to your healthcare team promptly

## [BASICS] Introduction to UC Medications
Think of these medications as tools in a toolbox - each one has its own special job in helping to control inflammation and manage your symptoms.

## [MEDICATIONS] Detailed Treatment Guide

### [5-ASA] Aminosalicylates
These are often the first-line medications for UC, targeting inflammation directly in the intestines. They are best for mild to moderate disease and work by reducing the production of inflammatory chemicals in the gut lining.

#### Mesalamine (Brands: Asacol HD, Delzicol, Lialda, Pentasa)
- Mechanism of Action: Releases anti-inflammatory agents in specific parts of the digestive tract, depending on the formulation
- Forms: Pills (for systemic treatment), suppositories, or enemas (for rectal/sigmoid disease)
- Dosing: Usually requires multiple pills daily. Extended-release forms (e.g., Lialda) may allow once-daily dosing
- Side Effects: Generally well-tolerated. Mild side effects include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Rarely, can cause kidney issues or pancreatitis
- Tips:
  - Take extended-release forms with food; immediate-release may need to be taken on an empty stomach
  - Ensure proper hydration to reduce kidney-related risks

#### Sulfasalazine (Brand: Azulfidine)
- Mechanism of Action: Converted to mesalamine in the colon but contains a sulfa component, which can cause additional side effects
- Dosing: Typically taken 3-4 times daily. Start at low doses to minimize side effects
- Side Effects: More likely than mesalamine to cause nausea, vomiting, headache, and rashes. Rare risk of reduced sperm count (reversible)
- Tips:
  - Take with food to minimize gastrointestinal upset
  - Always take folic acid supplements (1 mg/day) due to interference with folate absorption

### [STEROIDS] Corticosteroids
Used for acute flare-ups of UC due to their powerful, broad anti-inflammatory effects. Not suitable for long-term management due to potential serious side effects.

#### Prednisone
- Mechanism of Action: Reduces inflammation by suppressing immune activity systemically
- Dosing: Oral tablets; doses typically taper down gradually to avoid withdrawal or adrenal insufficiency
- Side Effects: Weight gain, mood changes, insomnia, acne, increased blood sugar, and risk of infections. Long-term use can lead to osteoporosis and eye problems
- Tips:
  - Take in the morning to mimic natural cortisol levels and reduce sleep disturbances
  - Do not discontinue suddenly; tapering is essential

#### Budesonide (Brand: Uceris)
- Mechanism of Action: A locally acting steroid that primarily targets the gut with fewer systemic effects
- Dosing: Oral delayed-release tablets, typically taken once daily
- Side Effects: Generally mild but can include nausea, headache, or fatigue
- Tips:
  - Can be taken with or without food
  - Useful for mild to moderate flares, particularly in the colon

### [IMMUNE] Immunomodulators
These medications suppress the overactive immune response, providing long-term disease control but requiring time to take effect.

#### Azathioprine (Brand: Imuran)
- Mechanism of Action: Converts into a compound that inhibits DNA synthesis in immune cells, reducing inflammation
- Dosing: Taken as a daily oral tablet, dose adjusted based on weight and tolerability
- Side Effects: Nausea, fatigue, reduced blood cell counts, increased risk of infections, and rarely, liver toxicity or pancreatitis. Requires regular blood tests
- Tips:
  - Avoid sun exposure; use sunscreen, as it may increase skin cancer risk
  - Ensure TPMT (thiopurine methyltransferase) enzyme levels are tested before starting, as deficiency increases toxicity risk

#### Mercaptopurine (Brand: Purinethol)
- Mechanism of Action: Similar to azathioprine but converted into active metabolites slightly differently
- Dosing: Typically taken as a single daily dose
- Side Effects: Similar to azathioprine; may cause liver or blood count abnormalities
- Tips:
  - Regular blood tests for liver function and blood counts are essential
  - Take consistently at the same time daily for optimal effect

### [BIOLOGICS] Targeted Treatments
Advanced therapies designed to block specific molecules involved in inflammation. Effective for moderate to severe UC or if other treatments fail.

#### Infliximab (Brand: Remicade)
- Mechanism of Action: Blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a key inflammation-causing protein
- Dosing: Administered via IV infusion at weeks 0, 2, and 6, then every 8 weeks
- Side Effects: Infusion reactions (e.g., fever, rash), increased risk of infections, reactivation of latent TB, or hepatitis B
- Tips:
  - Screen for TB and hepatitis before starting treatment
  - Schedule infusions consistently and allow 2-3 hours for the procedure

#### Adalimumab (Brand: Humira)
- Mechanism of Action: Similar to infliximab but delivered through self-injection
- Dosing: Initial loading doses followed by maintenance injections every 2 weeks
- Side Effects: Local injection site reactions, mild pain, or infection risk
- Tips:
  - Allow prefilled pens to reach room temperature before injecting
  - Rotate injection sites to reduce irritation

#### Vedolizumab (Brand: Entyvio)
- Mechanism of Action: Specifically targets integrins in the gut, reducing localized inflammation without systemic immune suppression
- Dosing: IV infusion at weeks 0, 2, and 6, then every 8 weeks. Subcutaneous injections also available
- Side Effects: Typically mild (headache, cold symptoms). Low infection risk
- Tips:
  - A good choice for patients who fail TNF inhibitors or are at higher infection risk

### [JAK] JAK Inhibitors

#### Tofacitinib (Brand: Xeljanz)
- Mechanism of Action: Inhibits Janus kinases (JAK) to block signals that drive inflammation
- Dosing: Oral tablets, taken twice daily
- Side Effects: May include infections, increased cholesterol, or blood clots (rare but serious)
- Tips:
  - Requires regular blood tests for lipid levels and liver function
  - Quick onset of action compared to biologics, making it useful for flares

### Important Treatment Notes
- Monitoring: Most UC medications require periodic blood tests for safety, especially immunomodulators, biologics, and JAK inhibitors
- Vaccinations: Ensure vaccines, including those for flu and pneumonia, are up to date before starting immunosuppressive therapies
- Lifestyle Support: Focus on a nutrient-dense diet, manage stress, and maintain hydration. Avoid NSAIDs, which can worsen symptoms


## [MANAGEMENT] Important Tips for All Medications

### General Medication Tips
1. Never stop any medication without talking to your doctor
2. Keep a medication diary or use a pill organizer
3. Set phone reminders for doses
4. Store medications properly (check if they need refrigeration)
5. Plan ahead for refills

### When Taking Multiple Medications
- Use a medication chart or app
- Take photos of all your pills for reference
- Keep a list of all medications with you
- Tell all your doctors about everything you're taking

### Warning Signs to Watch For
Contact your healthcare team if you experience:
- Severe side effects
- New or unusual symptoms
- Signs of infection (fever, severe tiredness)
- Problems affording medications

### Working with Your Healthcare Team
- Be honest about any missed doses
- Report side effects promptly
- Discuss any concerns about costs

Remember: These medications help many people achieve and maintain remission. While the list of possible side effects might seem scary, most people tolerate their medications well. The benefits usually outweigh the risks for people with UC. Always discuss any concerns with your healthcare team - they're there to help you find the best treatment plan for your situation.
